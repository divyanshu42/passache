Kelly's Passage Retreival System
by Kelly Itakura (kelly.itakura@gmail.com)

==Algorithm==
This implements a passage retreival algorithm, where all possible
arbitrary passages are ranked using OkapiBM25, and then overlaps 
eliminated. The results are the set of passages starting and ending
in keywords because otherwise the OKapi score would be lower.

Passage overlaps are eliminated because of the assumption that 
users do not want to read the same text over and over.
Say from the highest scored to the lowest scored, we had three
passages (1,4), (2,5), (5,6), where the numbers in the brackets denote
word positions in the corpus. Then (2,5) is eliminated because it 
overlaps (1,4), but (5,6) is not eliminated because it does not overlap
(1,4), and (2,5) is already eliminated from the ranked list.

==System Requirement==
It was developed on a *nix system using Perl and C++, you may need to intsall
a Perl module, Getopt::Long;, from CPAN.

==How to Run==
1. "setup.perl" --only needs to be run once.
It downloads, configures, and installs, the underlying system Wumpus search engine developped by Stefan BÃ¼ttcher: http://www.wumpus-search.org/. 
After this it installs the Wikipedia corpus and index the corpus by 
the Wumpus search system.

2. "run.perl" 
It can be used as a single-run system without training, or can be passed 
parameters k, b, etc. to train the system. Training obviously gives better
results.
